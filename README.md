This is my attempt at creating my own social networking app to obide by CSU33032 Project 2:
Securing Social Media Applications
The aim of this project is to develop a secure social media application for Facebook, Twitter,
WhatsApp etc., or for your own social networking app. For example, your application will secure the
Facebook Wall, such that only people that are part of your “Secure Facebook Group” will be able to
decrypt each other’s posts. To all other users of the system the post will appear as ciphertext.
You are required to design and implement a suitable key management system for your application
which employs public-key certificates that allows users of the system to share social media
messages securely and allows one to add or remove users from the group. You are free to implement
your application for a desktop or mobile platform and make use of any open-source cryptographic
libraries. 
Chat GPT was also used briefly to streamline some of the social media creation process
