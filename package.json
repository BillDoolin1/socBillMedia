To all other users of the system the post will appear as ciphertext.\r You are required to design and implement a suitable key management system for your application\r which employs public-key certificates that allows users of the system to share social media\r messages securely and allows one to add or remove users from the group. You are free to implement\r your application for a desktop or mobile platform and make use of any open-source cryptographic\r libraries.",
